# Ottawa-traffic-video-crawler

City of Ottawa kindly provides an API for downloading live images from the traffic video cameras in the city. Once you get a certiciate using the registration form, you are free to download traffic images from hundreds of cameras. Using this crawler, you can easily make a real world traffic dataset.

Before using the script, you should register yourself at https://traffic.ottawa.ca/ts/rsadmin/certificate.jsp
Then, type the certificate string that you received via email in the script.
